- [ x ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

I would choose function components, because it seems to me like lesser implementation of code.

- [ x ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

1. componentDidMount- Which can be considered the birth of the component. This is also where your app loads up and renders.

2. componentDidUpdate- Which can be considered the life of the component. This is also where if new state is added. The component would update.

3. componentWillUnmount- Which can be considered the death of the component. This is where the component would be dismounted and is not being rendered anymore.

- [ x ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

To create DRY resusable code / stateful logic.

- [ x ] Why is it important to test our apps?

It minimizes the risk of having bugs in our code.
